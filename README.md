# Farthest-On-Circle

## Introduction
Tool that uses ArcGIS technology to find out how far a vessel may get in a certain period of time. This could be useful if you need to estimate a ship's location.

This tool could be used to get an understanding where a vessel may be located in a number of hours.

A user interacts with the tool by dropping a location of the ship's current, or last known location, and puts in a speed (in kts) and range for the analysis to be conducted. The output will display the amount of time a ship will get to a certain location. 

The farthest on circle uses a mask layer of suitable locations. For instance, boats travel on the water and a mask would have all water areas =1, and land areas = 0. The model will calculate the least cost distance from the shipâ€™s location.  The mask of suitable locations can be created from various inputs, such as bathymetry information, or a generic mask of only water areas. 

## Sample Data
In this instance, the mask layer (watermaskworld1km) is a raster layer of water locations at 1km resolution. This dataset was created from the Esri's Countries Layer Package, where all country values (land areas) were marked as not suitable for navigation and all areas that are ocean are suitable. One could use a mask layer that is more restrictive, such as one that takes into account bathymetry, or restricted areas that ship cannot or will not pass through.

## Steps

The steps are outlined in the video [Farthest On Circle Tutorial](https://github.com/jfrygeo/Farthest-On-Circle/tree/master/FarthestOnCircle/Video).

1. Download the repository
2. Navigate to the folder above in Windows Explorer and copy the folder UNC path above the "FarthestOnCircleArcGISPro.gpkx" tool.
3. Open ArcGIS Pro
4. Navigate to the "Folders" section of ArcGIS Pro's "Catalog" Window
5. Right-Click on "Folders" and select "Add Folder Connection"
6. Input the UNC folder path in step 2
7. Right-Click "FarthestOnCircleArcGISPro.gpkx" and select "Add to Project"
8. Navigate in ArcGIS to the "Analysis" tab and then choose "History"
9. In the "History" window, double click the "Farthest On Circle Hours"
10. Fill out the parameters in the tool and press "Run."



### Known issues
The sample dataset, (watermaskworld1km), has some issues as not all water areas are located in the dataset. For instance, inland bodies are water are not included, as well as small bodies of water such as canals, or narrow straits.
